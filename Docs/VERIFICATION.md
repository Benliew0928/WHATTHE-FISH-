# Verification record — 22 September 2026

## Completed

- Android ARM64 IL2CPP development APK built successfully: **52,083,383 bytes (52.1 MB / 49.7 MiB)**, below the 100 MB file target. APK metadata confirms package `com.umpsa.sportsprototype`, minimum API 26 and target API 36. Android `apksigner verify` passes with a v2 signature. This is build/package verification, not a physical-device launch test.
- APK SHA-256: `CC512A1431171CD4965C9EAFCD66BD8A315F87BAC0F3405F487D80F77C77F04E`.
- New general-audience Unity cloud project linked in saved project settings. Real anonymous authentication, session creation, session-code joining and Relay transport passed with two Windows processes. Movement, readiness, character appearances and changed stadium settings replicated; host start and return reached the guest. Evidence: `Builds/cloud-host2.txt`, `Builds/cloud-guest2.txt`.
- The reported camera conflict came from the diagnostic `-viewScreen` code overriding the view each frame. That override was removed. The rebuilt interactive player visibly switched from first-person to third-person using the Camera button and displayed 60 FPS on this laptop. Phone drag/multitouch remains unverified.
- Real cloud capacity/isolation test: Room A held ten players and rejected an eleventh with `lobby is full`; Room B simultaneously held two players with independent phase and movement. Joining Room B during exploration returned `lobby is locked`. A stale code returned `lobby not found`. Host departure in the two-client cloud test produced `connected=False`, `exploring=False` and the friendly connection-closed message. Evidence: `Builds/CloudQA-20260922-225455/` and `Builds/cloud-guest2.txt`. Reproduce using `Tools/Build/Test-CloudRooms.ps1`.

- Unity 6000.3.20f1 project imports and C# compilation pass. URP 17.3.0, Multiplayer Services 2.3.3 and NGO 2.13.3 compile together against the installed editor.
- Original stadium and athlete export from Blender 5.1.2. Stadium inspected in a Blender render from elevated and pitch-level views. Both assets imported into Unity and used in the Windows player.
- Stadium FBX reduced from approximately 12.1 MB to 1.93 MB by simplifying repeated seat geometry. Final editable sources remain outside Unity. No spectator NPCs or crowd audio added.
- Windows development player builds and launches. Visual inspection performed on the actual native game window: main menu, character customiser, third-person and elevated stadium views. All three camera positions also exercised by the offline probe.
- Latest Windows development build output is approximately 170.1 MB uncompressed. This includes the Windows engine/runtime and is not an Android APK size estimate.
- Offline movement probe moved the avatar 4.8 m; no internet/UGS initialisation was needed. Chibi Idle/Walk/Run clips imported and the runtime Animator evaluated. The on-screen FPS indicator displayed 30 FPS on this laptop; this is **not** a phone performance measurement.
- Character colour selections made in the customiser persisted across player launches. The changeable hair tuft and skin/hair/outfit preset controls are implemented.
- Two independent NGO/Transport loopback rooms ran simultaneously on ports 7777 and 7778. Room A contained ten players, Room B two. Their player counts and transforms remained separate.
- Room A rejected an eleventh process with `This room is full (10 players).`
- Server-owned spawn positions were distinct. Movement was simulated by the host and matched across client logs; character appearance IDs and ready state replicated.
- Host start changed every client's exploration phase. Host return changed every client back to the waiting phase. A later join attempt during exploration was rejected.
- Host process exit disconnected guests and returned the application from exploration to menu state (`connected=False`, `exploring=False`). A disconnect reason was available to the UI.
- A separate two-process test replicated a changed host stadium preset (`TEST 7780`, lilac palette, design 2, team welcome, flags off) to the guest during exploration. Evidence: `Builds/preset-host.txt` and `Builds/preset-client.txt`.

Evidence: `Builds/NetworkQA/*.txt` and `*.log`, `Builds/smoke.txt`, `Builds/scene-audit.txt`, build logs and Blender review PNGs. These generated evidence files are excluded from Git. The reproducible local room test is `Tools/Build/Test-LocalRooms.ps1`. Development probes run only with explicit `-probe` arguments.

## Still awaiting access / not passed

| Requirement | Status |
|---|---|
| Android development APK | Passed build, signature and package checks; physical launch pending. |
| Physical Android launch, touch/multitouch, camera clipping | Not tested on a phone. `adb devices` returned no device. Desktop checks do not prove these. |
| Sustained 30 FPS on Android and APK below 100 MB | APK size passes at 52.1 MB. Sustained Android FPS and thermal behaviour require a phone. |
| Internet sessions across different networks | Real cloud/Relay tests passed on this PC's connection. Two separate physical networks still need testing. A separate named development environment remains pending dashboard access; builds currently use the new prototype project's default environment. |
| Invalid cloud codes, cloud-full room errors, network outages | Stale-code, full-room, locked-room and host-disconnect paths passed via live services. Broader network outage/recovery testing remains pending. |
| Ten users through Relay and simultaneous cloud sessions | Passed using independent Windows processes on this PC. Different physical devices/networks remain pending. |
| Stadium preset replication over internet/Relay | Passed with two Windows processes using real Relay; separate physical networks remain pending. |
| Broad device/aspect-ratio coverage | Pending. UI uses landscape scaling and safe-area anchors; test phones/tablets before publishing. |
| Huawei achievements/results | Explicit placeholder only. HMS SDK registration/integration is a later task. |

## Known prototype limits

- No football ball, scoring, timers, bots, spectator population, basketball arena or golf island.
- No host migration, client prediction, reconnect/resume or dedicated servers.
- One static full-size stadium. Seats are consolidated by material, so editing individual seats requires Blender editing/regeneration rather than runtime object manipulation.
- Stadium signs use runtime world-space UI. Font legibility and face orientation should be reviewed at close range on the phone before release.
- The startup art uses solid colours, not image textures. It does not depend on an external asset pack.
- Native desktop drag automation delivered pointer-down but no subsequent drag events in the touch-pad trace. Actual multitouch dragging still needs testing on the phone; this check has not been counted as passed.
- Scene rebuild and art regeneration intentionally replace generated outputs; save manual variants separately.
